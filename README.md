Data Set - Fashion MNIST . . . with a Twist!
This is an image dataset based on publicly available dataset Fashion MNIST:
https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist
As shown in Fig. 1 The dataset is composed of small (28x28 pixels), grey-scale images of clothing
items such as shoes, coats, pants, etc. It was created to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the
well known MNIST dataset (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset for benchmarking
machine learning algorithms. So the dataset shares the same image size and structure as the
original MNIST.
The Twist...
The label was originally an assigned clothing type represented by an integer from 0-9. The training
set contains 60,000 examples and the test set 10,000 examples.
For this assignment, we are providing you the same input features, but the labels you will
be using will be a new mystery label. We have created a new label based on the data and
calculated to be associated with each entry. The y train and y test  les provide this modi ed
label which is a category numbered 0-4. What does the number mean? That's for you to  gure
out through your analysis!
